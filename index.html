        <div class="indexp"><p>The Blue Period of Picasso is the period between 1900 and 1904, when he painted essentially monochromatic
            paintings in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colors. These somber works,
            inspired by Spain but painted in Paris, are now some of his most popular works, although he had difficulty
            selling them at the time. Picasso settled in Paris in 1904, having spent a few difficult years with no fixed
            studio and little artistic success. While back in 1903, he had produced his Blue Period works, which seemed
            to reflect his experience of relative poverty and instability, depicting beggars, street urchins, the old
            and frail and the blind. Here are some of his most important artworks of this period:</p>

                <p>Portrait of Suzanne Bloch is a painting executed by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso in Paris in
                    1904, towards the end of his blue period. The subject, Suzanne Bloch, was a singer known for her
                    Wagner interpretations, and the sister of the violinist Henri Bloch.</p>

                    class="mainImg">
                <p>La Vie (The Life) was painted in Barcelona in May 1903. It portrays two pairs of people, a naked
                    couple confronting a mother bearing a child in her arms. In the background of the room, apparently a
                    studio, there are two paintings within the painting, the upper one showing a crouching and embracing
                    nude couple, the lower one showing a lonesome crouching nude person very similar to Sorrow by
                    Vincent Van Gogh. With this Picasso repainted another motif, a birdsman who attacks a reclining
                    naked woman, traces of which are visible to the naked eye.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
                <h3>Child with a Dove</h3>
                <p>The painting depicts a small child, probably a girl, with short ginger hair wearing a white gown tied
                    at the waist with a blue sash. The subject stands holding a white dove in two hands, beside a ball
                    with brightly coloured segments like a colour wheel. The background is painted flatly, an abstracted
                    blue sky and green grass.
                    The work can be read as a picture of the innocence of childhood; as an essay in abstraction, with
                    shapes simplified and superfluous details left out; or as a commentary on colour theory, with large
                    blocks of colour - orange hair set against blue sky, and white dress set against green grass. It is
                    thickly painted, perhaps concealing an earlier work underneath. The potential sentimentality of the
                    subject matter is avoided by the use of bright colours. </p>

                <h1>Femme aux Bras Croisés</h1>
                <h3 class="lead">Woman with Folded Arms</h3>
                <p>The subject of the painting is unknown, but she may be an inmate of the Saint-Lazare hospital-prison
                    in Paris.
                    In her book Pablo Picasso, Antonina Vallentin devotes a great deal of time to writing about the
                    haunting qualities of this painting. She describes her views of the subject as an inmate, who
                    recently attempted suicide and now carries the blank but menacing stare of those unfortunates who
                    found themselves at Saint-Lazare during the early 1900s.</p>

                    class="mainImg">
                <p>In The Blue Room we can see Picasso’s blue period being fully developed. His cool hues and strong use
                    of natural light draw the viewer in to see this young idealized woman bathing in a tub in what we
                    can assume is her bedroom. Although the painting could be described as patchy or mildly unclear, the
                    subject and scene are still identifiable. The woman's figure and small studio background are typical
                    of Picasso's blue period, as seen in other works such as The Blind Man’s Meal (1903). Among
                    Picasso's monochromatic paintings, The Blue Room has a significant role along with The Old Guitarist
                    due to their rich details and inspiration sources rather than other portraits of the artist. The
                    poster on the wall and colors chosen carefully to allude hope as inner meaning, come forefront in a
                    superficial examination.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aboutcol lastcol col-md-4">
                <h3>La Gommeuse</h3>
                <p>The painting was executed in the second half of 1901 following Picasso's successful exhibition at the
                    Vollard gallery that June. This was at the start of his Blue period of 1901 to 1904, thought to have
                    been occasioned by the suicide of his friend Carlos Casagemas earlier in the year, a time when his
                    paintings were somewhat melancholic and characterized by somber monochromatic tones in blue and
                    green.
                    The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Mañach on the reverse is inscribed "Recuerdo a Mañach en el
                    día de su santo", demonstrating the painting was intended as a gift for Mañach on his Saint's Day
                    (29 June). Mañach was a Catalan anarchist who shared Picasso's studio flat in the Boulevard de
                    Clichy. He worked as a talent scout for art dealers and was responsible for organising Picasso's
                    successful 1901 Vollard show. A portrait of Mañach, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington,
                    was a feature of the show.</p>
