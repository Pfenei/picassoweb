      <h3>About the author
      </h3>
      <p>Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist
        and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. Regarded as one of the most influential artists
        of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed
        sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and
        explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937),
        a
        dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.

        Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through
        his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented
        with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the slightly older artist Henri
        Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists,
        who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.

        Picasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the
        most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the
        African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also
        referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical
        style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines
        elements of his earlier styles. </p>

        <p>Picasso's Rose Period represents an important epoch in the life and work of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso
          and had a great impact on the developments of modern art. It began in 1904 at a time when Picasso settled in
          Montmartre at the Bateau-Lavoir among bohemian poets and writers. Following Picasso's Blue Period, depicting
          themes of poverty, loneliness, and despair in somber tones of daunting blues, Picasso's Rose Period represents
          more pleasant themes of clowns, harlequins, and carnival performers, depicted in cheerful vivid hues of red,
          orange, pink and earth tones.</p>

          class="aboutimg">
        <p class="indexp">In the early 20th century, African artworks were being brought back to Paris museums in consequence of the
          expansion of the French empire into Sub-Saharan Africa. The press was abuzz with exaggerated stories of
          cannibalism and exotic tales about the African kingdom of Dahomey. The mistreatment of Africans in the Belgian
          Congo was exposed in Joseph Conrad's popular book Heart of Darkness. It was natural in this climate of African
          interest that Picasso would look towards African artworks as inspiration for some of his work; his interest
          was sparked by Henri Matisse who showed him a mask from the Dan people of Africa.</p>
